# SolarSystem
 
A implementation and modification of the Solar System project made by Sebastian Lague. I cut a lot of features, but also added new features.

The biggest features I added were the ability to save and load meshes and materials generated by the planet generator. I also modified the generator so the variables are more readable and manageable within the editor.
